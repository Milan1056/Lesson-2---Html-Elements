        <h3>
            Did you know there are over 3 trillion trees on Earth which is a 1000000 times more than a million! And 390 billion of
            those trees come from the amazon rainforest, which is situated in not only 1 country but spans across 9 countries: 
            Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana
            (an overseas territory of France).

            Did you know there are 100 billion to 5.3 trillion planets in the observable milky way (our galaxy) and only 1 lonely
            planet has humans living on it!

            This shows us that even though we might be living on a planet with 8 billion different people of our kind we still are 1
            person on a planet with 5.3 trillion others in only our galaxy.
