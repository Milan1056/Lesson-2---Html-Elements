            I was born on September 9th 2013 and was raised in Kerla.<br>
        </b>
        <strong>
            It was a 3 person family for a while until November 1st 2017 when my first sibling was born.<br>
        </strong>
        <i>
            His name was Adam and for a while my parents lived with the whole family instead of sometimes leaving me with my
            grandparents.<br>
        </i>
        <em>
            My favourite hobbies were football, cricket so mostly sports.<br>

            It was until I was in year 4 when I really started to try to focus on my studies and my exams later on.<br>

            It was in a blink of an eye and I was already in year 6 doing my 11+ exam which I had practised for, over 2 years of
            work had been put into this.<br>

            I thought I would fail, but somehow when the last tests results came I actually passed!<br>
        </del>
        I was excited then ever but I still had Sats so once I finished it last second on a maths test paper I realised I had gotten
        a simple square number question wrong: 6<sup>
            3
        </sup>

        I also am now practising science where I have to learn elements such as: CO<sub>
            2<br>
